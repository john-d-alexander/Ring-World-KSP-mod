# Cyla - Cylindrical atmospheres rendering

This is a quick KSP plugin to add Cylindrical atmospheres to KSP vessels, for use with Niven rings or O'Neill cylinders.

There will be a new part in Utility named "Cylindrical atmosphere renderer", add that to your craft to get started.

Note that I don't plan to develop this mode further, unless someone makes a robust O'Neill cylinder or Niven ring mod with functional gravity.
# Settings
Opening the part GUI brings up the following settings menu, you can change settings in editors or in flight.

## Dimensions
Refer to this diagram

Transparent radius has also been added and denotes the radius of the transparent section (so a part of the wall between inner and outer radius can be made transparent).

## Lighting mode
There's a few lighting modes you can select from, we can understand the lighting modes by looking at this diagram of a cross-section

 - TransparentTopAndSides: Top is transparent, and the side is transparent up to a configurable radius, other parts will cast shadows, use for Niven rings with a non-zero inner radius, optionally a part of the side wall can be made transparent with the transparent radius. Can also emulate O'Neill cylinders lit from the sides by setting the inner radius to zero and configuring the transparent raidius.
 - TransparentFloor
 - Unlit: Light always reaches all parts of the atmo, no sunsets or color shifts with distance, use when you can't see the atmo due to geometry/self-shadowing.

## Atmosphere settings
The atmosphere settings include classic rayleigh and mie settings, note these are normalized relative to (outerRadius-innerRadius) so rescaling the dimensions mostly keeps the same look. With the scale height settings, make sure the atmosphere falls off sufficiently before reaching the inner radius or you end up with a hard cutoff.

# Installation
Go to [releases](https://github.com/LGhassen/Cyla/releases) and grab the latest .zip. Unzip it, merge the provided GameData folder with your game's GameData folder (typically **C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\common\Kerbal Space Program\GameData**).

You should see the following folder structure:

```
Kerbal Space program
└──────GameData
		└──────Cyla
```

Make sure you downloaded the release linked above and not the code, if you see Cyla-Master you messed up and downloaded the code.
